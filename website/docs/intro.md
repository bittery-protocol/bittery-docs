# Bittery Protocol

Bitcoin records value, but it does not coordinate people. That limitation makes lotteries feel out of place on Bitcoin: a lottery is a social ritual where rules are published, people respond, and the outcome must be beyond dispute. Bitcoin handles the money; everything else traditionally lives elsewhere.

Inscriptions let people anchor art, messages, and identity to satoshis. They provide permanence, not participation. Most inscriptions sit quietly after minting and do little to change the creator’s life unless markets keep trading them.

Lotteries are different. A ticket marks an event and a shared moment. People keep tickets long after the draw because a ticket carries a memory, not just a price.

Bittery makes that ritual native to Bitcoin. A round is a small on-chain document—an inscription anyone can read. A ticket is a Bitcoin transaction that carries just enough structured data for the round to recognize it. Rules are data. Entries are data. Bitcoin stores them without opinion, so anyone can reconstruct a round directly from the chain.

Once rules and entries are data, any system that can read Bitcoin can execute: from simple scripts to verifiable randomness and threshold signatures; from clustered services to a single machine. Bittery does not dictate the machinery—only what must be true when the chain is interpreted. Execution stays off-chain, so no one is locked to a specific operator. Anyone can issue a round, implement a validator, and reproduce outcomes. The inscription fixes the rules once the round begins.

For artists, the artwork becomes the face of a round—the image tied to that specific moment. Tickets are artifacts bound to that art and event, not just claims on payout. Art returns to being part of a shared experience instead of a speculative asset.

Bittery is not an economic engine; it is a clean way to express rounds, entries, outcomes, and artifacts so anyone can participate without permission and verify without trust. Bitcoin does what it already does well, and people choose how to build on top.

## Why Bittery Is a Protocol

Bittery is written as a protocol rather than an application for a simple reason: the useful parts of a lottery—its rules, its entries, and its outcome—should not belong to any particular operator.

An application comes and goes with the person who runs it. A protocol does not. If the round description is on Bitcoin and the entries are on Bitcoin, then anyone can build a tool that interprets them, and anyone can reproduce the result without relying on the original issuer. Nothing about the system depends on a website, an interface, or a company staying alive.

By keeping Bittery at the level of formats and rules, the work can be carried on by whoever finds it useful. One implementation may use a sophisticated execution engine; another may use something much simpler. What matters is that the data on the chain is enough for all of them to agree on what happened. The protocol exists so that no one needs permission to issue a round, and no one needs trust to verify one.
